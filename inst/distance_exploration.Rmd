Exploring Genetic Distances in R
================================

Distances between genetic material in R is a complicated topic. There are two
main packages that implements distance functions:
* ape::dist.dna
* Biostrings::stringDist and Biostrings::pairwiseAlignment

The problems with these functions are:
* ape::dist.dna
  * Only for DNA not for AA
  * Cannot handle gap opening / gap extention penalties? (Not sure)
  * Always computes a distance matrix for a vector of strings. Computationally
    inefficient for computing a distance between a single string and a vector
    (or need some coding to make it efficient)
* Biostrings::stringDist
  * Works fine for like an edit distance
  * Uses Biostrings::pairwiseAlignment to compute alignment based distances.
    Thus all the problems of that function applies
  * Always computes a distance matrix for a vector of strings. Computationally
    inefficient for computing a distance between a single string and a vector
    (or need some coding to make it efficient)
* Biostrings::pairwiseAlignment
  * Aligns a single pattern to a vector of subjects.
  * Can return various statistics
  * When using a substitution matrix, the similarity score is returned and not
    the distance - hence it still need to be normalized.
  * Does not return a matrix of distances, so some code is needed to convert
    the vectors into a matrix of distances (or a distance object)
